# MemoRecipe

MemoRecipe is a personal project that started from a concrete need: being able to import recipes from photos or scans (magazines, handwritten notes), then correct, improve, and reuse them over time.

Beyond that personal need, the goal was also to stay current with the .NET ecosystem while working on a realistic, scalable project — and to explore two topics I was particularly interested in: integrating AI into a real application, and building proper security into it from the start.

## What It Does

The system lets users manage a personal cookbook, import recipes from images via OCR and AI parsing, correct and refine AI-extracted content, and access everything across web and mobile. The key design principle is that human validation and domain rules always take precedence over AI output — the AI is a tool, not a decision-maker.

## Architecture

The project is structured as a real full-stack application organized as a monorepo. The core is an ASP.NET Core .NET 10 API following Clean Architecture (Domain, Application, Infrastructure), with PostgreSQL for persistence, JWT authentication, and a rich domain model around recipes, users, and history.

The AI layer is intentionally separated: OCR and AI parsing run as Azure Functions. Local Tesseract handles OCR, then a contract-based LLM call structures the recipe. All business logic and decisions stay in the API — the AI never becomes the source of truth. Sensitive corrections like quantities and units are handled deterministically in code, with tests.

On the frontend side, the plan is a Blazor WASM web client and a MAUI mobile app, both consuming the same API contracts.

```

## Technology Foundation

The API runs on ASP.NET Core .NET 10 with PostgreSQL 16 (Docker) and Entity Framework Core 10. Authentication uses JWT Bearer. Input validation relies on FluentValidation. The AI pipeline uses Azure Functions .NET 8, Tesseract for local OCR, and Mistral as the LLM provider behind an abstraction layer. The frontend is built with Blazor WASM .NET 10 and MudBlazor. Tests use xUnit with fake implementations for both the LLM and the repository layer, keeping every test deterministic and free of external dependencies.

## Running Locally

**Prerequisites:** .NET 10 SDK, .NET 8 SDK, Docker Desktop, Azure Functions Core Tools, Tesseract, and `MISTRAL_API_KEY` set as an environment variable.

```bash
# Database
docker-compose up -d

# API → http://localhost:5131
cd memoRecipeAppProject/memorecipe-api
dotnet run --project src/MemoRecipe.Api

# Frontend → http://localhost:5110
cd App/MemoRecipe.Web
dotnet watch

# Azure Functions → http://localhost:7071
cd memoRecipe-ia
func start

# Tests
cd memoRecipeAppProject/memorecipe-api
dotnet test
```

> **Frontend without API:** swap `AuthService` for `FakeAuthService` in `Program.cs` to develop the UI without running the API or Docker.

> **Auth cookies:** JWT tokens are stored in `HttpOnly` cookies (never in `localStorage`). The `CookieHandler` ensures `credentials: include` is sent on every cross-origin request.

## Current Status

The pipeline architecture is in place — prompt engineering and AI parsing layer are functional. The main remaining challenge is Tesseract OCR output quality on real-world images. The full backend is done: JWT authentication via HttpOnly cookies, recipe CRUD with authorization, FluentValidation (4 validators, 71 unit tests), and global exception handling.

The Blazor frontend now covers Login/Register pages with inline validation, protected routes via CookieAuthStateProvider, responsive layout (sidebar desktop + bottom bar mobile), and a full scan recipe workflow. The user uploads an image, the IA pipeline extracts the recipe, and the result is displayed in a reusable `RecipeForm` component with all editable fields: title, description, servings, prep time, cook time, difficulty, public toggle, structured ingredients (name + delete), and ordered steps. A dedicated `RecipeFormModel` keeps the form decoupled from API DTOs — the same component will be reused for manual creation and recipe editing.

The full scan-to-save pipeline is now functional: scan → preview → edit → save to database. Form validation constraints match the backend FluentValidation rules (title length, portions range, time limits, max 50 ingredients/steps). A database migration was added to make `PrepTimeMinutes` and `CookTimeMinutes` nullable, reflecting the domain model.

Error handling is now in place: API responses are validated with `EnsureSuccessStatusCode`, errors display inline via `MudAlert`, and successful saves show a `MudSnackbar` toast. A recipe list page (`/recipes`) shows all saved recipes with loading states and empty-state messaging. The recipe detail page (`/recipes/{id}`) displays title, portions, ingredients, and ordered steps, with a delete button and `MudMessageBox` confirmation dialog. The edit page (`/recipes/{id}/edit`) reuses the shared `RecipeForm` component with pre-filled data and a code-behind pattern (`.razor` / `.razor.cs` separation). Form models (`IngredientFormModel`, `StepFormModel`) are now decoupled from API DTOs.

The dashboard (`/`) shows the recipe count via a dedicated `GET api/recipe/count` endpoint and the 5 most recent recipes using query params (`?limit=5&orderBy=createdAt`). The API now supports `RecipeQueryParams` for sorting, limiting and future pagination. All pages follow the code-behind pattern with `= default!` for injected properties (DEC-019).

Security hardening is underway: password hashing migrated from HMAC-SHA512 to PBKDF2 via `PasswordHasher<T>` (DEC-020) with rolling migration for existing users. Azure Function auth level changed from Anonymous to Function. A custom `SecurityHeadersMiddleware` (DEC-021) adds 6 security headers on every response: `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`, `Content-Security-Policy` (adapted for Blazor WASM + MudBlazor), and `Strict-Transport-Security` (production only). Integration tests verify all headers with `WebApplicationFactory`.

Rate limiting is in progress (BACK-002): fixed window per IP on auth (10/min), scan (5/min), and global (100/min) endpoints using ASP.NET Core's built-in `AddRateLimiter`. Per-account lockout after 5 consecutive failed logins (15-minute window) using `IMemoryCache` in `AuthService`. Integration tests pending.

Next steps: rate limiting tests, CORS dynamic configuration, RGPD compliance, and eventually the MAUI mobile client and CI/CD pipeline.
